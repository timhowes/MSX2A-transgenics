Additional File 3 - Analysis of transgenic sticklebacks expressing MSX2A

The file transgenic_analysis.R is an R language script that loads the CSV files
containing measurements from each of the experiments, performs comparisons
between the dorsal spines of transgenic and non-transgenic fish, and generates
the plots presented in Figure 5C.

Data files:

  transient_experiment_1.csv    Measurements of PAXB fish injected with Construct A,
                                including non-transgenic injected fish and uninjected siblings

  transient_experiment_2.csv    Measurements of PAXB fish injected with Construct A,
                                including non-transgenic injected fish and uninjected siblings

  stable_line_experiment_3.csv  Measurements from a cross between a PAXB fish carrying a stable
                                transgene of Construct B and a non-transgenic PAXB fish. Progeny
                                carrying the transgene were compared to wild-type siblings.
